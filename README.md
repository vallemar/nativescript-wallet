[Playground Preview](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nativescript-vue3-wallet?file=src%2Fcomponents%2FHome.vue) âš¡

\
Note: In Playground Preview Android animations will not bounce as the app uses the [`androidx.dynamicanimation:dynamicanimation`](https://github.com/vallemar/nativescript-wallet/blob/main/App_Resources/Android/app.gradle#L4)  animation library and the native dependencies are not available from preview. You can download the repository and run locally to see all the fancy android animations
